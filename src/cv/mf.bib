    abstract = {When the threat of COVID-19 became widely acknowledged, many hoped that this
                pandemic would squash “the anti-vaccine movement”. However, when vaccines started
                arriving in rich countries at the end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine hesitancy
                might be an issue even in the context of this major pandemic. Does it mean that the
                mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one of the main causes
                of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this paper, we wish to contribute
                to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic by looking at one
                of the many mechanisms which can cause reticence towards vaccines: the capacity of
                vaccine-critical activists to influence a wider public on social media. We analyze
                the evolution of debates over the COVID-19 vaccine on the French Twittosphere, during
                two first years of the pandemic, with a particular attention to the spreading
                capacity of vaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did
                vaccine-critical contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the main actors
                in the diffusion of these contents? While debates over vaccines experienced a
                tremendous surge during this period, the share of vaccine-critical contents in these
                debates remains stable except for a limited number of short periods associated with
                specific events. Secondly, analyzing the community structure of the re-tweets
                hyper-graph, we reconstruct the mesoscale structure of the information flows,
                identifying and characterizing the major communities of users. We analyze their role
                in the information ecosystem: the largest right-wing community has a typical
                echo-chamber behavior collecting all the vaccine-critical tweets from outside and
                recirculating it inside the community. The smaller left-wing community is less
                permeable to vaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once
                adopted.},

    abstract = {When access to diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis is disrupted by poverty or
                unequal access to health services, marginalized communities not only endorse the
                burden of preventable deaths, but also suffer from the dramatic consequences of a
                disease which impacts one's ability to access education and minimal financial
                incomes. Unfortunately, these pockets are often left unrecognized in the flow of data
                collected National tuberculosis reports, as localized hotspots are diluted in
                aggregated reports focusing on notified cases. Such system is therefore profoundly
                inadequate for identifying these marginalized groups, which urgently require adapted
                interventions. We computed an estimated incidence-rate map for the South-Kivu
                province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a province of 6.3 million inhabitants,
                leveraging available data including notified incidence, level of access to health
                care and exposition to identifiable risk factors. These estimations were validated in
                a prospective multi-centric study. We could demonstrate that combining different
                sources of openly-available data allows to precisely identify pockets of the
                population which endorses the biggest part of the burden of disease. We could
                precisely identify areas with a predicted annual incidence of >1%, a value three
                times higher than the national estimates. While hosting only 2.5% of the total
                population, we estimated that these areas were responsible for 23.5% of the actual
                tuberculosis cases of the province. The bacteriological results obtained from
                systematic screenings strongly correlated with the estimated incidence (r=0.86), and
                much less with the incidence reported from epidemiological reports (r=0.77),
                highlighting the inadequacy of these reports when used alone to guide disease control

    abstract = {Background Global roll-out of rapid molecular assays is revolutionising the
                diagnosis of rifampicin resistance, predictive of multidrug-resistance, in
                tuberculosis. However, 30\% of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in an eSwatini
                study harboured the Ile491Phe mutation in the rpoB gene, which is associated with
                poor rifampicin-based treatment outcomes but is missed by commercial molecular assays
                or scored as susceptible by phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing deployed in South
                Africa. We evaluated the presence of Ile491Phe among South African tuberculosis
                isolates reported as isoniazid-monoresistant according to current national testing
                algorithms. Methods We screened records of 37644 Mycobacterium tuberculosis positive
                cultures from four South African provinces, diagnosed at the National Health
                Laboratory Service–Dr George Mukhari Tertiary Laboratory, to identify isolates with
                rifampicin sensitivity and isoniazid resistance according to Xpert MTB/RIF, GenoType
                MTBDRplus, and BACTEC MGIT 960. Of 1823 isolates that met these criteria, 277 were
                randomly selected and screened for Ile491Phe with multiplex allele-specific PCR and
                Sanger sequencing of rpoB. Ile491Phe-positive strains (as well as 17
                Ile491Phe-bearing isolates from the eSwatini study) were then tested by Deeplex-MycTB
                deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing to evaluate their patterns of extensive
                resistance, transmission, and evolution. Findings Ile491Phe was identified in 37 (15
                \%) of 249 samples with valid multiplex allele-specific PCR and sequencing results,
                thus reclassifying them as MDR. All 37 isolates were additionally identified as
                genotypically resistant to all first-line drugs by Deeplex-MycTB. Six of the South
                African isolates harboured four distinct mutations potentially associated with
                decreased bedaquiline sensitivity. Consistent with Deeplex-MycTB genotypic profiles,
                whole-genome sequencing revealed concurrent silent spread in South Africa of a MDR
                tuberculosis strain lineage extending from the eSwatini outbreak and at least another
                independently emerged Ile491Phe-bearing lineage. Whole-genome sequencing further
                suggested acquisition of mechanisms compensating for the Ile491Phe fitness cost, and
                of additional bedaquiline resistance following the introduction of this drug in South
                Africa. Interpretation A substantial number of MDR tuberculosis cases harbouring the
                Ile491Phe mutation in the rpoB gene in South Africa are missed by current diagnostic
                strategies, resulting in ineffective first-line treatment, continued amplification of
                drug resistance, and concurrent silent spread in the community. },

                on a network can be coarse grained through the use of graph partitions. Specifically,
                we are interested in how aggregating the state space of a Markov process according to
                a partition impacts on the thus obtained lower-dimensional dynamics. We highlight
                that for a dynamics on a particular graph there may be multiple coarse grained
                descriptions that capture different, incomparable features of the original process.
                For instance, a coarse graining induced by one partition may be commensurate with a
                time-scale separation in the dynamics, while another coarse graining may correspond
                to a different lower-dimensional dynamics that preserves the Markov property of the
                original process. Taking inspiration from the literature of Computational Mechanics,
                we find that a convenient tool to summarize and visualize such dynamical properties
                of a coarse grained model (partition) is the entrogram. The entrogram gathers certain
                information-theoretic measures, which quantify how information flows across time
                steps. These information theoretic quantities include the entropy rate, as well as a
                measure for the memory contained in the process, i.e., how well the dynamics can be
                approximated by a first order Markov process. We use the entrogram to investigate how
                specific macro-scale connection patterns in the state--space transition graph of the
                original dynamics result in desirable properties of coarse grained descriptions. We
                thereby provide a fresh perspective on the interplay between structure and dynamics
                in networks, and the process of partitioning a network from an information theoretic
                perspective. To illustrate our points, we focus on networks that may be approximated
                by both a core-periphery or a clustered organization, and highlight that each of
                these coarse grained descriptions can capture different aspects of a Markov process

                governed by a potential energy function that, at present, we derive ad hoc from the

                perspective prompts for a consistent and unified approach to de novo and
                database-search methods, which is a distinctive feature of this approach over
                alternative ones: the characterization of the ground state of the model allows the de

                variables as a function of the (fictitious) temperature gives insight on the quality
                of the prediction, while the probability profiles at nonzero temperature reveal, on
                one hand, which fragments are more reliably predicted. On the other hand, they can be
                used as a spectrum-adapted, a posteriori score for database search. Results obtained
                with two different test data sets reveal a performance similar to that of other de

                embedding of Boolean logic gates into the ground-state subspace of such spin systems.
                We describe parameterized families of diagonal Hamiltonians and symmetry operations
                which preserve the ground-state subspace encoding the truth tables of Boolean
                formulas. The ground-state embeddings of adder circuits are used to illustrate how
                gates are combined and simplified using symmetry. Our work is relevant for
                experimental demonstrations of ground-state embeddings found in both classical
                optimization as well as adiabatic quantum optimization.},

                network-based processes ranging from quantum computing to biology and even sociology.
                Specifically, we analytically relate the average long-time probability distribution
                for the location of a unitary quantum walker to that of a corresponding classical
                walker. The distribution of the classical walker is proportional to the distribution
                of degrees, which measures the connectivity of the network nodes and underlies many
                methods for analyzing classical networks, including website ranking. The quantum
                distribution becomes exactly equal to the classical distribution when the walk has
                zero energy, and at higher energies, the difference, the so-called quantumness, is
                bounded by the energy of the initial state. We give an example for which the
                quantumness equals a R\'enyi entropy of the normalized weighted degrees, guiding us
                to regimes for which the classical degree-dependent result is recovered and others

                be it technological, social, biological or chemical, static or in interacting
                systems. In this paper, we extend the concept of community detection from classical
                to quantum systems---a crucial missing component of a theory of complex networks
                based on quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that certain quantum mechanical effects
                cannot be captured using current classical complex network tools and provide new
                methods that overcome these problems. Our approaches are based on defining closeness
                measures between nodes, and then maximizing modularity with hierarchical clustering.
                Our closeness functions are based on quantum transport probability and state fidelity
                , two important quantities in quantum information theory. To illustrate the
                effectiveness of our approach in detecting community structure in quantum systems, we
                provide several examples, including a naturally occurring light-harvesting complex,
                LHCII. The prediction of our simplest algorithm, semiclassical in nature, mostly
                agrees with a proposed partitioning for the LHCII found in quantum chemistry
                literature, whereas our fully quantum treatment of the problem uncovers a new,
                consistent, and appropriately quantum community structure.},

                symmetries that are unitary and those that are antiunitary. Unitary symmetries have
                been well studied whereas antiunitary symmetries and the physical implications
                associated with time-reversal symmetry breaking have had little influence on quantum
                information science. Here we develop a quantum circuits version of time-reversal
                symmetry theory, classifying time-symmetric and time-asymmetric Hamiltonians and
                circuits in terms of their underlying network elements and geometric structures.
                These results reveal that many of the typical quantum circuit networks found across
                the field of quantum information science exhibit time-asymmetry. We then
                experimentally implement the most fundamental time-reversal asymmetric process,
                applying local gates in an otherwise time-symmetric circuit to induce time-reversal
                asymmetry and thereby achieve (i) directional biasing in the transition probability
                between basis states, (ii) the enhancement of and (iii) the suppression of these

                them tend to be invisible to experimentalists. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis
                and exploiting the simplicity of tandem-repeat protein structures, we delineate a
                network of these states and the routes between them. We show that our target,
                gankyrin, a 226-residue 7-ankyrin-repeat protein, can access two alternative (un)
                folding pathways. We resolve intermediates as well as transition states, constituting
                a comprehensive series of snapshots that map early and late stages of the two
                pathways and show both to be polarized such that the repeat array progressively
                unravels from one end of the molecule or the other. Strikingly, we find that the
                protein folds via one pathway but unfolds via a different one. The origins of this
                behavior can be rationalized using the numerical results of a simple statistical
                mechanics model that allows us to visualize the equilibrium behavior as well as
                single-molecule folding/unfolding trajectories, thereby filling in the gaps that are
                not accessible to direct experimental observation. Our study highlights the
                complexity of repeat-protein folding arising from their symmetrical structures; at
                the same time, however, this structural simplicity enables us to dissect the
                complexity and thereby map the precise topography of the energy landscape in full
                breadth and remarkable detail. That we can recapitulate the key features of the
                folding mechanism by computational analysis of the native structure alone will help
                toward the ultimate goal of designed amino-acid sequences with made-to-measure
