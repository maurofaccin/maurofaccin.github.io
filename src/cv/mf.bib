    abstract = { We describe a new method for peptide sequencing based on the
        mapping of the interpretation of tandem mass spectra onto the analysis
        of the equilibrium distribution of a suitably defined physical model,
        whose variables describe the positions of the fragmentation sites along
        a discrete mass index. The model is governed by a potential energy
        function that, at present, we derive ad hoc from the distribution of
        peaks in a data set of experimental spectra. The statistical–physics
        perspective prompts for a consistent and unified approach to de novo
        and database-search methods, which is a distinctive feature of this
        approach over alternative ones: the characterization of the ground
        state of the model allows the de novo identification of the precursor
        peptide; the study of the thermodynamic variables as a function of
        the (fictitious) temperature gives insight on the quality of the
        prediction, while the probability profiles at nonzero temperature
        reveal, on one hand, which fragments are more reliably predicted. On
        the other hand, they can be used as a spectrum-adapted, a posteriori
        score for database search. Results obtained with two different test
        data sets reveal a performance similar to that of other de novo and
        database-search methods, which is reasonable, given the lack of an
        aggressive optimization of the energy function at this stage. An
        important feature of the method is that it is quite general and can
        be applied with different choices of the energy function: we discuss
        its possible improvements and generalizations. },

        of myotrophin, a small ankyrin repeat protein, whose folding
        equilibrium and kinetics have been recently characterized
        experimentally. The model, which is a native-centric with
        binary variables, provides a finer microscopic detail than the
        Ising model that has been recently applied to some different
        repeat proteins, while being still amenable for an exact
        solution. In partial agreement with the experiments, our
        results reveal a weakly three-state equilibrium and a
        two-state-like kinetics of the wild-type protein despite the
        presence of a nontrivial free-energy profile. These features
        appear to be related to a careful “design” of the free-energy
        landscape, so that mutations can alter this picture,
        stabilizing some intermediates and changing the position of the
        rate-limiting step. Also, the experimental findings of two
        alternative pathways, an N-terminal and a C-terminal one, are
        qualitatively confirmed, even if the variations in the rates
        upon the experimental mutations cannot be quantitatively
        reproduced. Interestingly, the folding and unfolding pathways
        appear to be different, even if closely related: a property
        that is not generally considered in the phenomenological
        interpretation of the experimental data.},

        Quantum mechanics still provides new unexpected effects when
        considering the transport of energy and information. Models of
        continuous time quantum walks, which implicitly use time-reversal
        symmetric Hamiltonians, have been intensely used to investigate
        the effectiveness of transport. Here we show how breaking
        time-reversal symmetry of the unitary dynamics in this model can
        enable directional control, enhancement, and suppression of
        quantum transport. Examples ranging from exciton transport to
        complex networks are presented. This opens new prospects for more
        efficient methods to transport energy and information.

        quantum computing to biology and even sociology. Specifically, we
        analytically relate the average long-time probability distribution
        for the location of a unitary quantum walker to that of a
        corresponding classical walker. The distribution of the classical
        walker is proportional to the distribution of degrees, which
        measures the connectivity of the network nodes and underlies many
        methods for analyzing classical networks, including website
        ranking. The quantum distribution becomes exactly equal to the
        classical distribution when the walk has zero energy, and at
        higher energies, the difference, the so-called quantumness, is
        bounded by the energy of the initial state. We give an example
        for which the quantumness equals a Rényi entropy of the
        normalized weighted degrees, guiding us to regimes for which
        the classical degree-dependent result is recovered and others

abstract = { Protein energy landscapes are highly complex, yet the vast
	majority of states within them tend to be invisible to
	experimentalists. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and
	exploiting the simplicity of tandem-repeat protein structures,
	we delineate a network of these states and the routes between them. We
	show that our target, gankyrin, a 226-residue 7-ankyrin-repeat
	protein, can access two alternative (un)folding pathways. We
	resolve intermediates as well as transition states,
	constituting a comprehensive series of snapshots that map early and
	late stages of the two pathways and show both to be polarized
	such that the repeat array progressively unravels from one end
	of the molecule or the other. Strikingly, we find that the
	protein folds via one pathway but unfolds via a different one.
	The origins of this behavior can be rationalized using the
	numerical results of a simple statistical mechanics model that
	allows us to visualize the equilibrium behavior as well as
	single-molecule folding/unfolding trajectories, thereby
	filling in the gaps that are not accessible to direct
	experimental observation. Our study highlights the complexity
	of repeat-protein folding arising from their symmetrical
	structures; at the same time, however, this structural
	simplicity enables us to dissect the complexity and thereby
	map the precise topography of the energy landscape in full
	breadth and remarkable detail. That we can recapitulate the
	key features of the folding mechanism by computational
	analysis of the native structure alone will help toward the
	ultimate goal of designed amino-acid sequences with
	made-to-measure folding mechanisms—the Holy Grail of protein
	folding.}
