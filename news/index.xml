      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;m presenting a poster in Dijon for the annual Complenet Conference on complex systems.
This international workshop on complex networks (CompleNet) aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on areas related to complex networks. In the past two decades we have been witnessing an exponential increase on the number of publications in this field. From biological systems to computer science, from economic to social systems, complex networks are becoming pervasive in many fields of science.</description>

      <description>Heading up in Wrocław to give a talk on the last work on Communities and Markovian processes on networks.
The NetSci-X is the primary winter conference on Network Science promoted by the NetSci Society. It brings together leading researchers and practitioners working in the emerging area of network science.
Great experience, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so cold and we enjoyed snow, beer, vodka and soups. Here You can find my slides if interested.</description>

      <description>Starting from today I move to Belgium to start a new life in an Applied Mathematics department.
Thanks to the &amp;ldquo;Movein&amp;rdquo; Fellowship program I can now work with JC Delvenne and his and other groups at ICTEAM/INMA. I&amp;rsquo;ll work on dynamical systems and dynamical networks surrounded by mathematicians and engineers (that&amp;rsquo;s a big change!).</description>

      <description>I gave a talk in Bologna at the Complenet workshop on Complex Networks. A lot of people attended and it was great. Sadly we still listen to talks that show how cool is a dataset with power-law degree distribution.
