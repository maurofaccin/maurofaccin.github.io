My main research interests include the analysis of dynamic systems that evolve and interact with complex topologies or networks.
This includes a wide range of interdisciplinary scenarios, from physics (my personal background) to medicine, from sociology to technology.
In particular, I focus on characterizing the topological features (such as community or other mesoscopic structures) of the underlying data that can be highlighted by the temporal evolution of the system.
I analyse those systems through the lenses of Information Theory, Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics.

I work as a PostDoc at [CEPED](https://www.ceped.org) (Université de Paris) in collaboration with the [IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement)](https://www.ird.fr).
I hold a visiting position in the [ARCS group](https://arcs.di.unito.it/) in the [Università di Torino](https://www.unito.it) department of informatics, Italy.
