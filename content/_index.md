I work as a PostDoc researcher at the
[Universit√© Catholique de Louvain](https://www.uclouvain.be), in the
[ICTEAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam) institute,
in Louvain-La-Neuve (Belgium).
My main research interests include the analysis of dynamical systems evolving
on and interacting with complex topologies or networks.
Under the wide category of such dynamical systems one can find simple models to
describe the diffusion of information on social networks, the spreading of diseases
on human or animal contact networks, blackout cascades on energy distribution
networks and many other diverse systems.

I analyse those systems applying tools from Information Theory, Statistical
Physics, Quantum Mechanics blended with results from the fast growing fields
of Network Science and Big Data.
