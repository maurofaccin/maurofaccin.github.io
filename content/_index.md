My main research interests include the analysis of dynamical systems evolving on and interacting with complex topologies or networks.
This includes a wide variety of interdisciplinary scenarios from physics (my own background) to medicine, from sociology to technology.
In particular I focus on the characterization of the topological features (such as community structures) of the underlying data that can be evinced from the system temporal evolution.
I analyse those systems applying tools from Information Theory, Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics.

I work as a PostDoc in the [ICTEAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam) institute ([Université Catholique de Louvain](https://www.uclouvain.be), Belgium) in collaboration with the [Medical Microbiology pole](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/irec/pole-de-microbiologie-medicale-mblg.html) ([Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc](https://www.saintluc.be/)) and [Savics](https://savics.org/).
I hold a visiting position in the [ARCS group](https://arcs.di.unito.it/) in the [Università di Torino](https://www.unito.it) department of informatics, Italy.
