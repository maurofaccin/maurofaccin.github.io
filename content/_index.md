I'm a PostDoc at the [DIMEC](https://www.dimec.unibo.it) department at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it).

My main research interests include the analysis of dynamic systems that evolve and interact with complex topologies or networks.
This includes a wide range of interdisciplinary scenarios, from physics (my personal background) to medicine, from sociology to technology.
In particular, I focus on characterizing the topological features (such as community or other mesoscopic structures) of the underlying data that emerge from the analysis of the dynamics.
I analyze those systems through the lenses of Information Theory, Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics.

I'm involved in:

- Estimating the Tuberculosis incidence rates in Sub-Saharan African regions (see [CartoTB](https://maurofaccin.github.io/cartotb))
- Writing a python package that compute the *best* partition of a network according to autoinformation maximization (see [AISA](https://maurofaccin.github.io/aisa)).
