I'm a PostDoc at the ComuneLab ([Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://dfa.unipd.it) of the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it)).

My main research interests lie in the analysis of dynamical systems that evolve and interact with complex topologies or networks.
This encompasses a wide range of interdisciplinary scenarios, from physics (my personal background) to medicine, from sociology to technology.
In particular, I concentrate on identifying and characterizing the topological features, such as community or other mesoscopic structures, that emerge from the analysis of the underlying data.
I approach these systems through the frameworks of Information Theory, Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics.

I'm involved in:

- Estimating the Tuberculosis incidence rates in Sub-Saharan African regions (see [CartoTB](https://maurofaccin.github.io/cartotb))
- Writing a python package that compute the *best* partition of a network according to autoinformation maximization (see [AISA](https://maurofaccin.github.io/aisa)).
