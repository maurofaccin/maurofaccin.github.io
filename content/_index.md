I hold a PostDoc position at [IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement)](https://www.ird.fr) in France and at [CEPED](https://www.ceped.org) (Université de Paris).

My main research interests include the analysis of dynamic systems that evolve and interact with complex topologies or networks.
This includes a wide range of interdisciplinary scenarios, from physics (my personal background) to medicine, from sociology to technology.
In particular, I focus on characterizing the topological features (such as community or other mesoscopic structures) of the underlying data that emerge from the analysis of the dynamics.
I analyse those systems through the lenses of Information Theory, Statistical Physics and Quantum Mechanics.
