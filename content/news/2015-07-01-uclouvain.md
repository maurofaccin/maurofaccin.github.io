Starting from today I move to Belgium to start a new life in an Applied
Mathematics department.

Thanks to the ["Movein" Fellowship program](https://www.uclouvain.be/en-movein.html)
I can now work with [JC Delvenne](http://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/)
and his and other groups at [ICTEAM/INMA](http://www.uclouvain.be/en-icteam.html).
I'll work on dynamical systems and dynamical networks surrounded by
mathematicians and engineers (that's a big change!).
