abstract: "Quantum mechanics still provides new unexpected effects when considering the transport of energy and information. Models of continuous time quantum walks, which implicitly use time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonians, have been intensely used to investigate the effectiveness of transport. Here we show how breaking time-reversal symmetry of the unitary dynamics in this model can enable directional control, enhancement, and suppression of quantum transport. Examples ranging from exciton transport to complex networks are presented. This opens new prospects for more efficient methods to transport energy and information."

Traditionally, the probability for a quantum walker to reach a node _j_ starting from a node _i_ is symmetric in time, and can be shown that _p<sub>i&rarr;j</sub>(t)=p<sub>j&rarr;i</sub>(t)_ for any _t_. In this article we introduce a family of topologies for which this symmetry if broken and we call them Chiral Quantum Walk. The introduction of complex terms in the Hamiltonian leads to sensible enhancement and suppression and directionality in the system transport.
