Since I was very young I've been taining in karate.
I always managed to follow [shotokan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan), one of the most traditional styles of karate.
I trained since I was 9 and I'm actually II Dan.
In this long period I stepped in a number of dojos and associations in different cities and
countries:

- Shin dojo (Costabissara): my first dojo with M. Paolo Scapin (FIKTA (ITKF), FESIK (WUKO)).
  In this context I participate to several regional competitions and some
  national (I was several time regional champion in kumite and once reached a
  third place in kumite in a national competition).

- [DimensioneK](http://www.dimensionek.it/), with M. Roberto Napoli (FIKTA (ITKF)) (Turin, Italy)
