I started training karate since I was very young, there was a brand-new dojo in my village, and I was curious.

I always managed to follow [shotokan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan), one of the most traditional styles of karate.
In this long period I stepped in many dojos and associations in different cities and countries, learning shotokan from different perspectives:

- **1989-2005**: Shin dojo (Costabissara). My first dojo with M. Paolo Scapin (FIKTA (ITKF), FESIK (WUKO)).
  In this context I participated to regional and some national competitions (I was several time regional champion in kumite and once reached a third place in kumite in a national competition).
- **2006-2010** [Almozara Sport Club](http://almozarasport.com/) (Zaragoza, Spain)
- **2012-2016** and **2019-2021** [DimensioneK](http://www.dimensionek.it/), with M. Roberto Napoli (FIKTA (ITKF)) (Turin, Italy)
- **2016-2019** [Deai](http://www.karate-do.be/description-club-karate-deai-k-c--ottignies-c48.php)
  M. De Troch Claude (JKA) (Ottignies, Belgium)
- **2021-today**: [Karate Bushido Schio](https://www.karateschio.com) with M. Daniela De Pretto (FIK) (Schio, Italy).
