`AISA` is a `python` module to perform state aggregation on graphs with associated dynamical systems.
It also provide a friendly interface to compute the Entrogram, a compact mathematical tool to asses the alignment of a proposed partition of a graph and the dynamical process.

Download the source code and read the documentation on [the project page](https://maurofaccin.github.io/aisa).
