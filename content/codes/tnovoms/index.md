T-novoMS is a combined de-novo/database-search tool for MSMS tandem
spectra identification. Providing one or a list of MSMS spectra (in
"dta" format), you will receive an email message with the
most-likely, de-novo predicted parent peptide, the best matching
peptide found in uniprot, and a measure of the reliability of the
de-novo and database-search predictions.
