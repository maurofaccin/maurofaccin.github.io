T-novoMS is a combined de-novo/database-search tool for MSMS tandem spectra identification.
Providing one or a list of MSMS spectra (in "dta" format), you will receive an email message with the most-likely, de-novo predicted parent peptide, the best matching peptide found in uniprot, and a measure of the reliability of the de-novo and database-search predictions.
