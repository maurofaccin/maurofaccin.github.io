      <title>Chiral Quantum Walks</title>

      <description>In this work we propose and carry out an NMR experiment to demonstrate the capabilities of a chiral quantum walk to control and direct the transport in a quantum system.
Here we develop a quantum circuit analog of the chiral walk theory showing that one can design a system that break the time symmetry.</description>

      <title>Community Detection in Quantum Complex Networks</title>

      <description>We extend the concept of community detection from classical to quantum systems, which provides a crucial missing tool for analyzing quantum systems with a network structure. As well as for analysis, we argue that breaking down a quantum system into strongly correlated parts, i.e., a form of community partitioning, is an essential precursor for any simulation that aims to use this partitioning to reduce computational cost.
To achieve the above goals we adapt traditional community detection methods that, as their starting point, use a measure of &amp;lsquo;closeness&amp;rsquo; for any two nodes.</description>

      <title>Degree distribution in quantum walks on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://maurofaccin.github.io/papers/2013-09-04-degree/</link>

      <description>The probability of finding a classical random walker, after a long time, on a node is proportional to the degree distribution of that node independently of the topology of the rest of the network.
A walker that obey quantum mechanics undergoes weird phenomena as interference, fluctuation, initial state dependence. The difference of its probability distribution from the classical counterpart depends on the system energy and entropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Enhancement by Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://maurofaccin.github.io/papers/2013-07-02-chiral-walks/</link>

      <description>Traditionally, the probability for a quantum walker to reach a node j starting from a node i is symmetric in time, and can be shown that pi&amp;rarr;j(t)=pj&amp;rarr;i(t) for any t. In this article we introduce a family of topologies for which this symmetry if broken and we call them Chiral Quantum Walk. The introduction of complex terms in the Hamiltonian leads to sensible enhancement and suppression and directionality in the system transport.</description>
