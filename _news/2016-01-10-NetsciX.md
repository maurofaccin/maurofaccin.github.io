Heading up in [Wrocław](http://netsci-x.net)
 to give a talk on the last work on Communities and
Markovian processes on networks.

The NetSci-X is the primary winter conference on Network Science promoted by the NetSci Society. It brings together leading researchers and practitioners working in the emerging area of network science.

Great experience, it wasn't so cold and we enjoyed snow, beer, vodka and soups.
Here You can find my [slides](/files/talk-netscix-2016.pdf) if
