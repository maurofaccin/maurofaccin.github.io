I gave a talk in Bologna at the 
[Complenet workshop on Complex Networks](http://2014.complenet.org/CompleNet_2014/Home.html).
A lot of people attended and it was great. 
Sadly we still listen to talks that show how cool is a
dataset with power-law degree distribution.

[Here](/files/talk-complenet-2014.pdf) you can find the slides of my talk.
