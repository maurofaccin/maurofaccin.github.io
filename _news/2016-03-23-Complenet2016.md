This time I'm presenting a poster in Dijon for the annual [Complenet](http://complenet.org/CompleNet_2016/Home.html)
Conference on complex systems.

This international workshop on complex networks (CompleNet) aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on areas related to complex networks. In the past two decades we have been witnessing an exponential increase on the number of publications in this field. From biological systems to computer science, from economic to social systems, complex networks are becoming pervasive in many fields of science. It is
this interdisciplinary nature of complex networks that CompleNet aims at addressing.
