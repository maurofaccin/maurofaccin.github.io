    abstract={Designing and optimizing cost functions and energy landscapes
        is a problem encountered in many fields of science and engineering.
        These landscapes and cost functions can be embedded and annealed in
        experimentally controllable spin Hamiltonians. Using an approach
        based on group theory and symmetries, we examine the embedding of
        Boolean logic gates into the ground-state subspace of such spin
        systems. We describe parameterized families of diagonal Hamiltonians
        and symmetry operations which preserve the ground-state subspace
        encoding the truth tables of Boolean formulas. The ground-state
        embeddings of adder circuits are used to illustrate how gates are
        combined and simplified using symmetry. Our work is relevant for
        experimental demonstrations of ground-state embeddings found in both
        classical optimization as well as adiabatic quantum optimization.},
