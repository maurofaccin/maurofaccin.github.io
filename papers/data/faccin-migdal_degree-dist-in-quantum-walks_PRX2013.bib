    abstract = {In this theoretical study, we analyze quantum walks on
        complex networks, which model network-based processes ranging from
        quantum computing to biology and even sociology. Specifically, we
        analytically relate the average long-time probability distribution
        for the location of a unitary quantum walker to that of a
        corresponding classical walker. The distribution of the classical
        walker is proportional to the distribution of degrees, which
        measures the connectivity of the network nodes and underlies many
        methods for analyzing classical networks, including website
        ranking. The quantum distribution becomes exactly equal to the
        classical distribution when the walk has zero energy, and at
        higher energies, the difference, the so-called quantumness, is
        bounded by the energy of the initial state. We give an example
        for which the quantumness equals a RÃ©nyi entropy of the
        normalized weighted degrees, guiding us to regimes for which
        the classical degree-dependent result is recovered and others
        for which quantum effects dominate.},
