abstract = { Protein energy landscapes are highly complex, yet the vast
	majority of states within them tend to be invisible to
	experimentalists. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and
	exploiting the simplicity of tandem-repeat protein structures,
	we delineate a network of these states and the routes between them. We
	show that our target, gankyrin, a 226-residue 7-ankyrin-repeat
	protein, can access two alternative (un)folding pathways. We
	resolve intermediates as well as transition states,
	constituting a comprehensive series of snapshots that map early and
	late stages of the two pathways and show both to be polarized
	such that the repeat array progressively unravels from one end
	of the molecule or the other. Strikingly, we find that the
	protein folds via one pathway but unfolds via a different one.
	The origins of this behavior can be rationalized using the
	numerical results of a simple statistical mechanics model that
	allows us to visualize the equilibrium behavior as well as
	single-molecule folding/unfolding trajectories, thereby
	filling in the gaps that are not accessible to direct
	experimental observation. Our study highlights the complexity
	of repeat-protein folding arising from their symmetrical
	structures; at the same time, however, this structural
	simplicity enables us to dissect the complexity and thereby
	map the precise topography of the energy landscape in full
	breadth and remarkable detail. That we can recapitulate the
	key features of the folding mechanism by computational
	analysis of the native structure alone will help toward the
	ultimate goal of designed amino-acid sequences with
	made-to-measure folding mechanismsâ€”the Holy Grail of protein
	folding.}
