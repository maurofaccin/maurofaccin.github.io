abstract: Recent progress in applying complex network theory to problems faced in quantum information and computation has resulted in a beneficial crossover between two fields. Complex network methods have successfully been used to characterize quantum walk and transport models, entangled communication networks, graph theoretic models of emergent space-time and in detecting community structure in quantum systems. Information physics is setting the stage for a theory of complex and networked systems with quantum information-inspired methods appearing in complex network science, including information-theoretic distance and correlation measures for network characterization. Novel quantum induced effects have been predicted in random graphs---where edges represent entangled links---and quantum computer algorithms have recently been proposed to offer super-polynomial enhancement for several network and graph theoretic problems. Here we review the results at the cutting edge, pinpointing the similarities and reconciling the differences found in the series of results at the intersection of these two fields.
