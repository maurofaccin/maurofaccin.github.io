        Quantum mechanics still provides new unexpected effects when
        considering the transport of energy and information. Models of
        continuous time quantum walks, which implicitly use time-reversal
        symmetric Hamiltonians, have been intensely used to investigate
        the effectiveness of transport. Here we show how breaking
        time-reversal symmetry of the unitary dynamics in this model can
        enable directional control, enhancement, and suppression of
        quantum transport. Examples ranging from exciton transport to
        complex networks are presented. This opens new prospects for more
        efficient methods to transport energy and information.
